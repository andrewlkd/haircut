DESCRIPTION: 
MRI demonstrated right contrast-enhancing temporal mass.
(Medical Transcription Sample Report)

SUBJECTIVE: 
The patient is a 55-year-old male that was last seen in clinic on 
07/29/2008 with diagnosis of new onset seizures and an MRI scan, which 
demonstrated right contrast-enhancing temporal mass. Given the 
characteristics of this mass and his new onset seizures, it is 
significantly concerning for a high-grade glioma.

OBJECTIVE: 
The patient is alert and oriented times three, GCS of 15. Cranial nerves 
II to XII are grossly intact. Motor exam demonstrates 2/5 strength in all 
four extremities. Sensation is intact to light touch, pain, temperature, 
and proprioception. Cerebellar exam is intact. Gait is normal and tandem 
on heels and toes. Speech is appropriate. Judgment is intact. Pupils are 
equal and reactive to light.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a new diagnosis of rim-enhancing 
right temporal mass. Given the characteristics of the MRI scan, it is 
highly likely that he demonstrates high-grade glioma and concerning for 
glioblastoma multiforme. We have discussed in length the possible benefits 
of biopsy, surgical resection, medical management, as well as 
chemotherapy, radiation treatments, and doing nothing. Given the high 
probability that the mass represents a high-grade glioma, the patient, 
after weighing the risks and the benefits of surgery, has agreed to 
undergo a surgical biopsy and resection of the mass as well as concomitant 
chemotherapy and radiation as the diagnosis demonstrates a high-grade 
glioma. The patient has signed consent for his right temporal craniotomy 
for biopsy and likely resection of right temporal brain tumor. He agrees 
that he will be n.p.o. after mid night on Wednesday night. He is sent for 
preoperative assessment with the Anesthesiology tomorrow morning. He has 
undergone vocational rehab assessment.


ALLERGIES:
Penicillin allergy. 

MEDICATION HISTORY:
The patient is not currently on any medications for seizures.

SOCIAL HISTORY:
Occupation: The patient works as a software engineer.
Alcohol: Reports occasional social drinking, approximately 1-2 drinks per 
week.
Substance Use: Denies illicit drug use.

FAMILY HISTORY:
There is no significant family history of brain tumors or neurological 
disorders.
Previous Medical Visits:
The patient had no significant medical history before the onset of 
seizures.
No recent hospitalizations or emergency room visits before the current 
clinic visit.

IMAGING STUDIES:
Recent MRI on 07/29/2008 demonstrated a right contrast-enhancing temporal 
mass.

NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION:
Alert and oriented times three, GCS of 15.
Cranial nerves II to XII are grossly intact.
Motor exam demonstrates 2/5 strength in all four extremities.
Sensation intact to light touch, pain, temperature, and proprioception.
Cerebellar exam is intact.
Gait is normal and tandem on heels and toes.
Speech is appropriate.
Pupils are equal and reactive to light.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
The patient, a 55-year-old male, presents with a new diagnosis of a 
rim-enhancing right temporal mass, highly suspicious for a high-grade 
glioma, possibly glioblastoma multiforme.
After a detailed discussion of treatment options, the patient has 
consented to undergo a surgical biopsy and resection of the mass.
The patient will also receive concomitant chemotherapy and radiation 
post-surgery.
Preoperative assessment with Anesthesiology scheduled for tomorrow 
morning.
Vocational rehab assessment has been completed.

FOLLOW-UP RECOMMENDATIONS:
Regular follow-up appointments to monitor the patient's neurological 
status and response to treatment.
Coordination with oncology for chemotherapy planning.
Regular imaging studies to assess treatment response and disease 
progression.
Patient Education:
Discuss potential side effects and expectations of surgical intervention, 
chemotherapy, and radiation.
Provide resources and support for the patient and their family to cope 
with the diagnosis and treatment.
